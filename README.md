# 360-VR-Senior-Project-.v2
My senior year project's final draft.
An interactive experience of the university I was attending.

You can find the previous version here: https://github.com/Jorim-M/360-VR-Senior-Project-.v1/

In this final draft I used Panorama.Js as opposed to A-Frame.io in the first one.

This is mainly because Panorama.Js was more lightweight, rendered scenes much better and was super easy to work with.

And I got to use scenes of the actual school instead just my dorm room :)

This project was completed in July 2021.




Happy Coding!
